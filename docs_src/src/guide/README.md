# Introduction

Welcome to the Goyave documentation!

This documentation is both a guide and a reference for Goyave application building. You will find instructions covering the basics as well as more advanced topics, from project setup to deployment. But first, let's talk about the framework itself.

Goyave is an **opinionated** Golang REST API framework aiming at **cleanliness**, **fast development** and **power**. Goyave applications stay clean and concise thanks to minimalist function calls and route handlers. The framework gives you all the tools to create an easily readable and maintainable web applications, which let you concentrate on the business logic. Although Goyave is a full package requiring very few setup and that handles many things for you, such as headers or marshaling, this characteristic doesn't compromise on your freedom of code.
